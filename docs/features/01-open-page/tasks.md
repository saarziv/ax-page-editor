# Open a Page – Tasks

Workflow, step format and deviation rules: see `CLAUDE.md` (SDD guidelines).

## T01 – Running skeleton ✓

**Goal:** web and api are fully set up, with every library from the global plan §2 configured. 01's key pieces exist as empty stubs, so the dev can click through start screen → Open → editor and see the server respond.

- [x] **S1 – Minimal wiring:** pnpm workspace with strict TS. `pnpm dev` runs core, api (`GET /api/health`) and web, and the web shows the health response.
- [x] **S2 – Quality scripts:** Vitest in core and api, ESLint (`no-explicit-any` as an error, react-hooks), and root `test`, `typecheck`, `lint` and `build` scripts.
- [x] **S3 – Web libraries:** Tailwind and shadcn/ui, TanStack Query (health moved to `useQuery`, with devtools), Zustand, and the `app/`, `editor/`, `state/` folders.
- [x] **S4 – API libraries:** env loading validated with zod (`API_PORT`, `WEB_ORIGIN`, `DB_PATH`), CORS limited to `WEB_ORIGIN`, a zod validation pipe, and better-sqlite3 installed.
- [x] **S5 – Feature stubs (no logic):** `normalizeUrl`, `clean`, `SafeFetchService`, `POST /api/snapshot` (fake "Stub page") and `GET /api/configs` exist with their final signatures. StartScreen and the editor placeholder switch on the store's `url`.
- [x] **S6 – E2E:** Playwright config at the repo root that reuses a running `pnpm dev`, plus a start → Open → "Stub page" smoke test, with `e2e:ui`, `e2e:headed` and `e2e:debug` scripts.

**Done when:** `pnpm dev` boots web and api, and the start screen → Open → stub editor flow works against the real API. `pnpm test`, `typecheck`, `lint`, `build` and `e2e` pass. `packages/core` has no I/O, Nest or React dependencies.

**Deviations:**

- Node `>=20.12` (built-in `.env` loading) → plan.md §2
- `.env.example` lives in `apps/api/`; e2e needs `playwright install chromium` on a fresh clone → plan.md §2
- Bodies validated per route with `@ZodBody`; invalid → 400 `INVALID_REQUEST` → plan.md §4.3

## T02 – Editor shell

**Goal:** the editor shows the spec's layout, and the preview shows a mock page returned by the BE.

- [x] **S1 – Shell layout (no BE call):** top bar with URL field + Open, preview panel on the left, disabled Hide / Context / Forward controls on the right.
  - **Verify:** open any URL from the start screen and see the three areas.
- [ ] **S2 – Mock page from the BE:** `POST /api/snapshot` returns a short mock page tree of an imaginary website (from the `clean` stub). The left panel renders it.
  - **Verify:** open any URL and see the mock page in the left panel.

**Done when:** both Verify actions pass, and `pnpm test` and `pnpm typecheck` pass.

## Follow-ups

- The web app hardcodes `http://localhost:3001`, so changing `API_PORT` breaks it. Fix: a Vite `/api` proxy or `VITE_API_URL`. (From T01 S4)
- Playwright starting the servers itself (no `pnpm dev` running) hasn't been exercised yet. (From T01 S6)
- Recent pages list on the start screen (pages with a saved configuration and their change counts). The `GET /api/configs` stub from T01 exists for it. Needs 05.
- "Built with JavaScript" banner when a page's visible text is nearly empty.
